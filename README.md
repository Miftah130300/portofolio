# My Portfolio Web

A website showcasing my journey in web development.

Since 2022, I have had a keen interest in the tech world, particularly in software engineering, product management, and digital marketing. I initiated my learning journey on Coursera by enrolling in a Front-end development course conducted by Meta. During this course, I gained knowledge of HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. In 2023, I decided to further enhance my skills by participating in the Kampus Merdeka program at Dicoding Indonesia. This program provided me with comprehensive knowledge, starting from the basics of front-end development to an advanced level. Additionally, I received a scholarship at IDCamp 2023, offering me the opportunity to delve into the impressive web framework, ReactJS.

## What's next?

Driven by my profound interest in technology, I aspire to delve into all aspects of software development, encompassing not only engineering but also design, development, and marketing. My goal is to create products that are not only of high quality but also fulfill market needs. I aim to become a product developer who comprehends every phase of the development process.
